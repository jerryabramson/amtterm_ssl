From Jerry Abramson

This project was started, and the majority of the original code written by, Gerd Hoffmann.

I found some additional work to support ssl, written by Andreas Steinmetz.

I added some additional SSL support, in particular I added support for client SSL certificates.

I also did some general cleanup, and enhanced logging options.
